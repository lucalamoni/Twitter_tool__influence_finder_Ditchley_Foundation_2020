    "## Handling Twitter Credentials for API-based access\n",
    "\n",
    "For Python modules such as `tweepy` or `python-twitter`, scraping is achieved by API calls.  Thus, API tokens are required in conjunction with code based on these modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than hard-coding access keys, which should be confidential, the code snipped below (which is based on code from the article here; https://stackabuse.com/accessing-the-twitter-api-with-python/) generates a json file which can be kept separate and can be loaded separately for security.  \n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: Check potential security issues with GitHub.  Probably want to tell any git repos to ignore the resulting json file.  "
